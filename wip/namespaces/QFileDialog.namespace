    QFileDialog::DontConfirmOverwrite	0x00000004	Don't ask for confirmation if an existing file is selected. By default confirmation is requested.
    QFileDialog::DontUseNativeDialog	0x00000010	Don't use the native file dialog. By default, the native file dialog is used unless you use a subclass of QFileDialog that contains the Q_OBJECT macro.
    QFileDialog::ReadOnly	0x00000020	Indicates that the model is readonly.
    QFileDialog::HideNameFilterDetails	0x00000040	Indicates if the file name filter details are hidden or not.
    QFileDialog::DontUseSheet	0x00000008	In previous versions of Qt, the static functions would create a sheet by default if the static function was given a parent. This is no longer supported and does nothing in Qt 4.5, The static functions will always be an application modal dialog. If you want to use sheets, use QFileDialog::open() instead.
