The Wip utility generates an .cpp file from an .wip file:

  - Change to the WipGen directory:

    cd WipGen

  - build the utility with to following command:

    hbmk2 wip.hbp



Building Library
================

QMake is required to create the makefiles in order to build the qtHarbour library

 * Mac/Linux: execute the script file:

   ./build.sh

 * Windows: execute the bat file:

   build.bat



Samples/Demos/Tests
===================

hbmk2 is used to build the binaries with the qtH.hbc config file, i.e.: to build
the demo at 'demos/hello/hello.prg':

  cd demos/hello
  hbmk2 ../../qtH.hbc -run hello
